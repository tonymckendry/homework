**Answer is in Readme**

I went into this assignment with zero knowledge of Go; It was quite the challenge, but I found it enjoyable in the end. 

I think it's a really well written problem, as everytime you start to make forward progress
you run into another new problem to research and figure out.

I had a particularly tough time with accessing the Body of the response (and had wondered where the hint in the readme was going to come into play).

The test is failing as it was written when I received it - I have checked my output over and over 
and come to the conclusion that you (probably) wouldnt give out the correct answer in the test and thus mine is (hopefully) correct. 

Here's to hoping I'm right!
